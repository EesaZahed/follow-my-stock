# follow-my-stock
Follow your stocks!

To add your own stocks, edit index.html and add your stock symbols to the <select>

I use finnhub's API for this project, and to use it for your self, just insert your finnhub API key (from finnhub.io)
Once you have the API key, edit script.js with the code: 

const APIKEY = Your_Key
